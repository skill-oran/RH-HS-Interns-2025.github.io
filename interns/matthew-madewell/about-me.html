    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Matthew Madewell and I am a senior at Ravenscroft High School from Wake Forest, NC.
      I am passionate about computer science, economics, and data, and the wonderful way in which they interact.
      I love to explore the connections and patterns that data reveals in various aspects of life. 
      One specific area I do this is in baseball, where my passion for playing has fueled my interest in statistical probabilities and outcomes within the game.
      Through my programming skills, I have created several AI/ML models that use MLB players' stats as inputs and produce outputs on what future production for those players could look like.
